# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Its the use of engineering principles in designing, building, testing and maintaining softawre for day to day use to solve and execute problems.
Reliabilty. which ensures softare peerforms to the expected standard. 
Efficient. this helps maintain flow while also mainataiang highest of standards.
sucure. helps mainatain highest level of trust as long as its properly maintained and protected from bugs and viruses.
Scalability. this helps it maintain smooth running given a higher load 
flexibilty. this helps manouvering and usage.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 mastering complexity, process and machine.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning. understanding what exactltly the software is about.
Requirements. this means gathering all that it needs to execute. such as dat and relevant tools
Design. giving a picture of what final product should look like.
implementing. this involves writing up the code to achive the desired design and framework.
testing. this is to see if the desired goals have been met in the final product.
maintaining. makes sure product is smooth and keeps its effiiency and also add improvements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is linear and sequential while agile is itertive and incremental.
waterfall involves phase by phase completion while agile is done with multiple cycles.
in watert=fall there is low flexibilty while in agile it has high flexibilty.
waterfall is hard to effect changes while in agile its possible to effect change.
waterfall gives customer feedback after phase completetion while in agile its incorporated all the way.
waterfall testing is done at the end of the development while its dones continuosly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1, A software developer is one who develops applications, programs and systems using programmimg language and frameworks, reporting progress, maimtains and updates and also works closely with the others.

2, A Quality Assurance Engineer creates standards and procedures to follow, confirmst comformity of software before its deployed, analyse for bugs and develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
3. Project Manager. Assembles lead software team, discuss project requirements with clients and software developers, create blue print and so on and finally deliver final product while doing regular check ups.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

1. Integrated developent envireonment is softaware platform  that facilitates creation of other software applications by providing space to write, compile and debug also enhancing by providing value adding tools to ease the processs for example visual studio code
some of the importance include
-contains inteeligent features that maintain programming rules.
- can automatically format some word to ease by making the more readable and give intant feedback about accidental syntax errors
- it gives suggestion when coding
- increases productivuty by performing repeatable development tasks.
- compiles code to simplified language.

2. Visusal Control Systems are software tools that help software teams manafe changes to source code over time. example is Git.
   importance include
   - enables collaboration of multiple software developers on same codebase without conflict
   - change tracking
   - branching and merging to new features
   - error recovery by helping revert to previous versions
     

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- rapid changes in the technology world. this is overcome by continously learning and adapting to new techonological features.
- time contraints. proper use of time and teamwork helps solve this.
- limited infrastructure. contomuos development and advancing infrastructure helps solve this
- software security. coctantly researching and implementing new ways to secure software.
- 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit tests.are close to the source of an application.
   importance: ensures each unit perforns its intended function correctly isolated from other components.
2. Integration Tests. verfy that different modules or services used by application work well together.
   imporatance: smooth flow of data between modules and interfaces work as expected.
3. System Testing: Focus on software wholistically
   importance: helps meet all functional and non functional requirements.
4. Acceptance Tests. formal tests that verifies if a system satisfies its intended use in business.
   Importance: ensures software meets end user needs.
   
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Process of guiding generative AI soulutions to generate desired outputs. 
Importance
1. Improved user experience
2. increased flexibility
3. developer control

   

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a vehicle.


Draw a small saloon, give it a sporty look and low to the ground. it should be blue in color and has a double exhaust at the back. the rims of the tires should be silver in have gaps.

1. Clarity. type of vehicle identified. in this small sporty car.
2. specific details. color, rim, size. space to the ground.
3. concise. narrowed down information.
